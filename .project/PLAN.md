# Plan

Source: `.project/SPEC.md` — Full Code Audit (Behavior-Preserving)

## Now

**State** — Branch `cleanup` COMPLETE, draft PR #1 open into `gleicon/tldt:main`. The full behavior-preserving audit (A-groups, R1–R15, C1–C3) plus the final 6-review `/ds-*` pass are shipped, followed by maintainer-requested follow-ups and a thread-3 hardening pass. Tree green on every commit: lint 0, `go test -race ./...` all pass, 15/15 golden byte-identical (the `--url` path is excluded). The audit (threads 1 & 2) kept the `pkg/tldt` API identical; thread 3 intentionally changed it — `Fetch`/`FetchRaw` gained a leading `context.Context` and `PipelineResult.Redactions` split into `InvisiblesRemoved` + `PIIRedactions` (module unreleased, so no compat break).

**Latest follow-ups (after the audit):**
- `e10f3b9` — final-review pass: 4 behavior-preserving fixes (vocabSize local, 2 test-quality fixes, example enc.Encode).
- `fbfbc58` — **S1** redaction coverage: `slack-token` pattern + shared `highEntropyBase64()` fed into `scanPII` (redacted as `[REDACTED:secret]`); AWS/generic skipped (FP risk; entropy gate >4.5 controls FPs); CLI/README/security.md/library.html synced.
- `8754267` — **FetchRaw**: hardened JSON/non-HTML fetch primitive (shared `doHardenedRequest`); `Fetch` output byte-identical; openapi example switched onto it → gains SSRF protection.
- `8e2a44e` — stripped leaked GSD lingo ("Phase 9") from `docs/security.md` + `docs/index.html`.
- **Thread-3 hardening** (`d9ca4e7`, `71654ad`, `3c72976`): installer fail-loudly (G7/G8/G9); `context.Context` on `Fetch`/`FetchRaw` (G2) + non-positive `maxBytes`/`timeout` preconditions (G1); `PipelineResult.Redactions` split; `--sanitize-pii` over-redaction trade-off documented. CLI golden 15/15 byte-identical; lint 0; tests added.
- **Remaining residuals** (`2a37094`, `ab92e47`): B1 (`=`-terminated high-entropy redaction miss + test), B2 (empty-DNS dial guard), Q1 (`resolveSettings` extract), Q4 (uniform fetch sentinels). Nothing deferred.

**Next** — Nothing outstanding. Everything is addressed in this PR; it merges in full.

**Open questions** — None blocking. Maintainer prior choices: R7 option A, R6 incl. SSN+Luhn, R13 full legacy removal, C1–C3, S1 option 2+Slack, thread-3 API changes (ctx + Redactions split) accepted since module unreleased, `.project/` kept tracked.

## Roadmap

### Baseline
- [x] Behavior baseline captured: build/vet/`test -race` all green; golangci-lint baseline = 19 issues (17 errcheck, 2 staticcheck)
- [x] Public API snapshot captured: `go doc -all ./pkg/tldt` saved (`.audit-baseline/pkg-tldt-api.txt`)
- [x] Golden I/O snapshot captured: 15 scenarios (stdin, `-f`, 4 algorithms × 3 formats, verbose, sanitize/detect) — stdout SHAs + stderr recorded; `--url` excluded per D-5

### Review pass (collect findings, no edits)
- [x] `/ds-bug-review` findings collected over active code
- [x] `/ds-security-review` findings collected over active code
- [x] `/ds-go-review` findings collected over active code
- [x] `/ds-code-quality-review` findings collected over active code
- [x] `/ds-test-quality-review` findings collected
- [x] `/ds-doc-quality-review` findings collected (README, docs/, package docs)
- [x] `/ds-deslop` findings collected
- [x] All findings consolidated and classified → `.project/AUDIT.md` (A=apply, B=recommend, C=opt-in refactor)
- [~] **CHECKPOINT: maintainer reviews AUDIT.md before any edit**

### Apply safe fixes (behavior-preserving only) — DONE
- [x] golangci-lint gate adopted (commit d2b03c9): `.golangci.yml` v2 defaults, `make lint` wired, tree green
- [x] Doc accuracy fixes (commit 3b88964): threshold drift, missing flags, dup/stale doc cleanup
- [x] Deslop + dead-code fixes (commit dd1aa2a): QuarantinedIdxs, false comments, micro-idioms
- [x] Test-quality fixes (commit f65f1b1): assertion-free tests converted; 9 coverage tests added
- [x] `go.mod`/`go.sum` unchanged (no imports became unused)

### Apply approved behavior-changing fixes (R1, R2, R4 — user-approved) — DONE
- [x] R1 (commit f2298ed): reject `--sentences < 1`; summarizer select clamps negative n
- [x] R4 (commit 829a816): fetcher returns real metadata + sentinel errors; pkg/tldt.Fetch uses errors.Is
- [x] R2 (commit ff1790c): SSRF dial-time IP validation (closes DNS-rebinding TOCTOU)

### Verify — DONE
- [x] API snapshot unchanged: exported `pkg/tldt` func/type set identical (FetchResult shape unchanged; values now truthful per R4)
- [x] Golden I/O unchanged: all 15 baseline scenarios match byte-for-byte
- [x] Suite parity: `go test -race ./...` passes (366 test funcs)
- [x] Build + vet + lint green on final tree
- [x] `go.mod`/`go.sum` unchanged after `go mod tidy` (NFR-4)
- [~] examples: `html-processor` builds; basic/pipeline/openapi-client have pre-existing stale go.mod (flagged R15)

### Report & ship — DONE
- [x] Consolidated audit report produced → `.project/AUDIT.md` (applied + remaining recommendations)
- [x] Fixes committed in 7 independently-revertible groups on `cleanup`
- [x] Remaining behavior-changing recommendations (R3, R5–R15, C1–C3) handed to maintainer in AUDIT.md

### Ending cleanup
- [x] Strip leaked planning IDs/lingo from code comments (commit 163cd34) — GSD IDs + audit R1 IDs removed across 13 files; comments only, golden/API unchanged.
- [x] R15 (commit 20d1c23): `go mod tidy` examples basic/pipeline/openapi-client (pre-existing stale go.mod). main module untouched.
- [x] R3 (commit 9228002): SSRF blocklist — unspecified/CGNAT/NAT64/benchmark; IPv4-mapped covered by regression tests.
- [x] R6 (commit 27ec822): PII coverage — modern sk-/GitHub/PEM/SSN + Luhn credit-card; detect/redact kept consistent.
- [x] Reviewed and applied ALL remaining B/C items one-by-one with maintainer: R3,R5,R6,R7(A),R8,R9,R10,R11,R12,R13,R14 + C1,C2,C3 (commits 9228002→68c1f01). See AUDIT.md "Section B + C — ALL APPLIED". Tree green throughout; golden + API parity held on every commit.
- [x] **Pre-pass hygiene** (commit 18f2f32): `go fix ./...` across all 5 modules — `interface{}`→`any`, C-style loops→range-int, `strings.Split`→`strings.SplitSeq`. Zero gopls hints remain anywhere. Verified build+vet+lint(0), `test -race` all pass, 15/15 golden byte-identical, `pkg/tldt` API func/type set unchanged. Rebuilt example binaries (tracked artifacts) restored, not committed.
- [x] Final `/ds-*` pass over the full audit diff — all six run sequentially (deslop last), each delegated:
  1. [x] `/ds-code-quality-review` — PASS; C1/C2/C3 delete duplication, no file near 1k, no spaghetti.
  2. [x] `/ds-go-review` — PASS; SSRF dial path + DetectOutliers idiomatic; 1 major (example enc.Encode) + minor nits.
  3. [x] `/ds-bug-review` — PASS; SSRF/Luhn/outlier/clamps verified by repro. 1 reproduced advisory-only edge (base64 re-pad).
  4. [x] `/ds-security-review` — PASS; TOCTOU closed, ReDoS impossible, installer safe. 1 High coverage gap (S1).
  5. [x] `/ds-test-quality-review` — PASS; security paths well-covered. 2 test-only fixes applied (T1/T2).
  6. [x] `/ds-deslop` — PASS; code clean (prior deslop did the work). 1 trivial fix (D2), 4 candidates refuted.
  - [x] Consolidated into AUDIT.md "Final review pass"; 4 behavior-preserving fixes applied (`e10f3b9`), rest recommended.

### Maintainer-requested follow-ups (post-review)
- [x] **S1** redaction coverage (commit `fbfbc58`): `slack-token` pattern + shared `highEntropyBase64()` feeding `scanPII` so `--sanitize-pii` redacts Slack tokens and prefix-less high-entropy secrets as `[REDACTED:secret]`. AWS/generic standalone patterns skipped (FP risk). Docs synced. Golden + API parity held.
- [x] **FetchRaw** (commit `8754267`): extracted `doHardenedRequest` shared by `Fetch`/`FetchRaw`; `Fetch` byte-identical; `pkg/tldt.FetchRaw` wrapper; openapi example switched off its unprotected `http.Client`. Tests: raw-body, non-2xx, byte cap, dial-time SSRF. API addition is additive.
- [x] **GSD doc lingo strip** (commit `8e2a44e`): removed "Phase 9" from `docs/security.md` (→ bare Mitigation/Example) and `docs/index.html` (status → "mitigated"). Swept docs/README/code — no other planning lingo remains.
- [x] **`.project/` checkpoint**: refreshed PLAN/AUDIT/PROJECT to final state; deleted stale `handoff.md`. `.project/` stays tracked (goes with the PR).
- [x] Open draft PR `lucindo:cleanup` → `gleicon/tldt:main` — **PR #1** (https://github.com/gleicon/tldt/pull/1). Note: S1 test fixtures (fake Slack token + AWS-example key) tripped GitHub push protection; commits `fbfbc58..` were rewritten with de-contiguated fixtures (local backup tag `backup-cleanup-presecret`).
